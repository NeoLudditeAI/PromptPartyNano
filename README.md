# üçå Prompt Party: Nano Banana Edit Mode üß™

A collaborative image editing game powered by Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview (Nano Banana). Players take turns making small edits to an evolving image, showcasing the advanced capabilities of iterative AI image editing.

## üéÆ How It Works

1. **Start**: Upload a photo or generate from a rich text prompt
2. **Edit**: Each player submits ‚â§45-character edit commands (e.g., "rm coffee mug + hat")
3. **Fusion**: Optionally attach reference images for style transfer (planned)
4. **Reveal**: See the updated image with feature badges showing Nano Banana capabilities (planned)
5. **Share**: Download the final image with the complete edit chain (planned)

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Iterative Editing**: Multi-turn image editing that builds on previous results ‚úÖ
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Turn-based editing with live updates ‚úÖ
- **Image History**: Navigate through the creative journey ‚úÖ
- **Reaction System**: Emoji reactions on generated images ‚úÖ
- **Multi-image Fusion**: Style transfer and composition with reference images (planned)
- **High-fidelity Text**: Render readable text within images (planned)
- **Feature Badges**: Visual indicators of Nano Banana capabilities used (planned)
- **SynthID Verification**: Google's watermark for AI-generated content (planned)

## üçå Nano Banana Capabilities Showcased

- **Text-to-Image**: Generate start images from rich descriptions ‚úÖ
- **Image-to-Image Editing**: Iterative modifications with ‚â§45-char commands ‚úÖ
- **Consistency**: Maintain visual coherence across edits ‚úÖ
- **Multi-image Fusion**: Combine reference images for style transfer (planned)
- **High-fidelity Text Rendering**: Create readable text within images (planned)
- **SynthID**: Watermark verification for AI-generated content (planned)
