# 🍌 Prompt Party: Nano Banana Integration Roadmap

**CRITICAL APPROACH**: Create an IDENTICAL game to the original PromptParty, simply replacing DALL-E 3 with Google's Nano Banana image generation model.

---

## 🎯 **Development Philosophy & Best Practices**

### **Incremental Development Strategy**
We follow a strict incremental approach to avoid rabbit holes and complex debugging scenarios:

- **One Change at a Time**: Never make multiple changes simultaneously
- **Test After Each Change**: Verify functionality before proceeding to the next step
- **Maintain Identical Structure**: Keep 100% feature parity with original PromptParty
- **Avoid Feature Creep**: Focus only on the API switch, no additional features until basic functionality is proven
- **Game Flow Validation**: Test each step of the corrected game flow before proceeding

### **Quality Assurance Principles**
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Each change must be tested before moving forward
- **Clear Documentation**: Document every change and its impact
- **Rollback Ready**: Each change should be easily reversible if issues arise
- **Production Validation**: Test in production environment (Vercel) when local issues persist

### **Anti-Patterns We Avoid**
- ❌ **Rabbit Hole Development**: Getting sidetracked by interesting but non-essential features
- ❌ **Multi-Change Debugging**: Making several changes and then trying to debug complex interactions
- ❌ **Premature Optimization**: Adding complexity before basic functionality is proven
- ❌ **Scope Creep**: Adding features beyond the core API switch requirement

### **Success Metrics**
- ✅ **Identical Gameplay**: Exact same experience as original PromptParty
- ✅ **Working API Integration**: Nano Banana generates images successfully
- ✅ **No Regressions**: All existing features continue to work
- ✅ **Clean Codebase**: Maintainable, well-documented code

### **Corrected Game Flow & Testing Strategy** 🎯
**New Game Mechanics**: Player 1 creates seed image BEFORE game starts, then Player 2 gets first turn

**Testing Approach**:
1. **Pre-Game Phase**: Test seed creation (upload + generate) before game starts
2. **Lobby Phase**: Test seed image display and "waiting for Player 2" messaging
3. **Gameplay Phase**: Test Player 2's first edit turn and subsequent turns
4. **Image Consistency**: Test that edits maintain subject identity across turns
5. **Turn Flow**: Verify correct turn progression (Player 2 → Player 3 → Player 1 → etc.)

**Incremental Testing Steps**:
- [ ] Test seed image creation (upload path)
- [ ] Test seed image creation (generate path)  
- [ ] Test lobby display with seed image
- [ ] Test Player 2's first turn submission
- [ ] Test edit command processing with Nano Banana
- [ ] Test complete game flow end-to-end

### **CORRECTED GAME FLOW** 🎯
**New Understanding**: Player 1 creates seed image BEFORE game starts, then Player 2 gets first turn
- **Turn 0**: Player 1 creates seed (upload OR generate) - happens during game creation
- **Turn 1**: Player 2 submits first edit command
- **Turn 2+**: Subsequent players submit edit commands
- **Image History**: `imageHistory[0] = seed`, `imageHistory[1] = first edit`, etc.

### **Pre-Game Seed Creation** ✅
- [✅] **Update game creation flow** - Player 1 must create seed before game starts
- [✅] **Seed image storage** - Store initial image in game state (base64 or URL)
- [✅] **Lobby display** - Show seed image with "Starting image ready! Waiting for [Player 1] to start the game"
- [✅] **Turn flow correction** - Game starts with Player 2's turn, not Player 1

### **Edit Command System** ✅
- [✅] **Edit turn submission** - Replace prompt building with edit commands
- [✅] **Pass-through processing** - Send commands directly to Nano Banana
- [✅] **Character limit validation** - ≤25 character edit commands

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting & Debugging Strategy**

### **Incremental Debugging Philosophy**
We follow a systematic, one-issue-at-a-time approach to avoid complex debugging scenarios:

1. **Single Issue Focus** - Identify and fix ONE problem at a time
2. **Test After Each Fix** - Verify the fix works before moving to the next issue
3. **Document Everything** - Log every step, result, and decision
4. **Use Production Environment** - Deploy to Vercel if local issues persist
5. **Rollback if Needed** - Revert changes that cause new problems

### **Current Issues Identified**
- ❌ **Placeholder API** - Not using real Nano Banana API calls
- ❌ **Local server issues** - May need production testing
- ❌ **API response format** - Need to verify actual Nano Banana response structure

### **Debugging Process**
1. **Environment Check** - Verify GEMINI_API_KEY is loaded correctly
2. **API Integration** - Implement real Nano Banana API calls
3. **Response Validation** - Confirm API returns expected image data
4. **End-to-End Testing** - Test complete game flow with real images
5. **Production Deployment** - Deploy to Vercel for final validation

### **Quality Gates**
- ✅ **API Integration Complete** - Real Nano Banana calls working
- ✅ **Image Generation Verified** - Images appear in game
- ✅ **Game Flow Intact** - All original functionality preserved
- ✅ **No New Bugs** - No regressions introduced

### **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
- ❌ **Multi-Issue Debugging** - Don't try to fix multiple problems simultaneously
- ❌ **Assumption-Based Fixes** - Don't guess at solutions without testing
- ❌ **Scope Expansion** - Don't add features while debugging
- ❌ **Complex Changes** - Keep each change simple and focused

This approach ensures we maintain a clean, working codebase while successfully integrating the Nano Banana API.
