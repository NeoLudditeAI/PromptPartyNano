# üçå Prompt Party: Nano Banana Integration Roadmap

**CRITICAL APPROACH**: Create an IDENTICAL game to the original PromptParty, simply replacing DALL-E 3 with Google's Nano Banana image generation model.

---

## üéØ **Development Philosophy & Best Practices**

### **Incremental Development Strategy**
We follow a strict incremental approach to avoid rabbit holes and complex debugging scenarios:

- **One Change at a Time**: Never make multiple changes simultaneously
- **Test After Each Change**: Verify functionality before proceeding to the next step
- **Maintain Identical Structure**: Keep 100% feature parity with original PromptParty
- **Avoid Feature Creep**: Focus only on the API switch, no additional features until basic functionality is proven

### **Quality Assurance Principles**
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Each change must be tested before moving forward
- **Clear Documentation**: Document every change and its impact
- **Rollback Ready**: Each change should be easily reversible if issues arise
- **Production Validation**: Test in production environment (Vercel) when local issues persist

### **Anti-Patterns We Avoid**
- ‚ùå **Rabbit Hole Development**: Getting sidetracked by interesting but non-essential features
- ‚ùå **Multi-Change Debugging**: Making several changes and then trying to debug complex interactions
- ‚ùå **Premature Optimization**: Adding complexity before basic functionality is proven
- ‚ùå **Scope Creep**: Adding features beyond the core API switch requirement

### **Success Metrics**
- ‚úÖ **Identical Gameplay**: Exact same experience as original PromptParty
- ‚úÖ **Working API Integration**: Nano Banana generates images successfully
- ‚úÖ **No Regressions**: All existing features continue to work
- ‚úÖ **Clean Codebase**: Maintainable, well-documented code

## üîß **Troubleshooting & Debugging Strategy**

### **Incremental Debugging Philosophy**
We follow a systematic, one-issue-at-a-time approach to avoid complex debugging scenarios:

1. **Single Issue Focus** - Identify and fix ONE problem at a time
2. **Test After Each Fix** - Verify the fix works before moving to the next issue
3. **Document Everything** - Log every step, result, and decision
4. **Use Production Environment** - Deploy to Vercel if local issues persist
5. **Rollback if Needed** - Revert changes that cause new problems

### **Current Issues Identified**
- ‚ùå **Placeholder API** - Not using real Nano Banana API calls
- ‚ùå **Local server issues** - May need production testing
- ‚ùå **API response format** - Need to verify actual Nano Banana response structure

### **Debugging Process**
1. **Environment Check** - Verify GEMINI_API_KEY is loaded correctly
2. **API Integration** - Implement real Nano Banana API calls
3. **Response Validation** - Confirm API returns expected image data
4. **End-to-End Testing** - Test complete game flow with real images
5. **Production Deployment** - Deploy to Vercel for final validation

### **Quality Gates**
- ‚úÖ **API Integration Complete** - Real Nano Banana calls working
- ‚úÖ **Image Generation Verified** - Images appear in game
- ‚úÖ **Game Flow Intact** - All original functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ **No New Bugs** - No regressions introduced

### **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**
- ‚ùå **Multi-Issue Debugging** - Don't try to fix multiple problems simultaneously
- ‚ùå **Assumption-Based Fixes** - Don't guess at solutions without testing
- ‚ùå **Scope Expansion** - Don't add features while debugging
- ‚ùå **Complex Changes** - Keep each change simple and focused

This approach ensures we maintain a clean, working codebase while successfully integrating the Nano Banana API.
